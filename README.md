# About wires

Choosing the right wire is an essential step when building any electronic project. The wire must be able to carry the required current safely, and its insulation must be suitable for the project’s environment.

Two main factors determine whether a wire is appropriate:

**1. Conductor thickness**
This affects how much **current** the wire can carry without overheating.

**2. Insulation thickness and material**
This affects how well the wire can handle the **voltage** and protect against short circuits, heat, and physical damage.

### WIRE THICKNESS GUIDE


| Voltage / Use | Wire Size (mm²)  | Typical Current (A) | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 3 V or lower  | 0.22 | ≤ 0.5 | Very low current, flexible wire for breadboards and small modules |
| 5 V electronics  | 0.5  | 0.5–2 | Suitable for low-current projects, short runs, and single modules |
| 5 V electronics  | 0.75  | 2–5 | Use for higher current draws or longer cable runs |
| 12 V low-current  | 0.5–0.75  | 2–5 | Suitable for light 12 V circuits; use flexible automotive cable |
| 12 V higher-current  | 1.0–1.5  | 5–10 | Thicker wire needed for higher current draws or longer runs |
| High Voltage / Mains | Follow UK T&E or flex standards  | Varies | Consult a qualified technician. Risk assessment and PAT testing required. |

### High Voltage + PAT Testing

Any mains voltage or other high-voltage systems **require special cable types and professional knowledge**. 

**Please approach a hackSpace technician if your project requires connections to the mains.**

Using the wrong cable can create a fire or shock hazard.

A **Risk Assessment document** signed by your Tutor will be requested if your project involves High Voltage.

Once your High Voltage project has been wired, you won't be allowed to take the project with you until you provide evidence of a PAT test that confirms that your project is safe. 

KU provides free PAT testing through our KU electricians. You can request it via your Tutor. Please note that arranging an appointment may take some time.
